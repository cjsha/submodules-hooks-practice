User Guide
*************************************************

..  attention:: If you haven't verified the core functionality of your Open
    Ephys commutator, refer to the :ref:`quick_start_spi` guide.

The coaxial commutator can be used with ultra lightweight, high-bandwidth coaxial cables to provide near zero-torque
commutation of `miniscopes <https://open-ephys.org/miniscope-v4/miniscope-v4>`__  or
`coaxial headstages <https://open-ephys.github.io/onix-docs/Hardware%20Guide/Headstages/index.html>`__. This user
guide details how to use the coaxial commutator for this purpose.
