..  important:: Although this example uses `Bonsai <https://bonsai-rx.org>`__ and Windows, the commutator communicates
    over a serial connection using a simple :ref:`set of JSON commands <remote_control_:dry:`shorthand`>` and
    therefore is software and operating system agnostic.

This quick start guide provides a basic setup instructions to verify the commutator's functionality.  By following
these steps, you will be able to turn the commutator using keyboard presses from a
`Bonsai Visual Programming Language <https://bonsai-rx.org>`__ workflow.

# If you have not already done so,

   * `Download and Install Bonsai <https://bonsai-rx.org/docs/articles/installation.html>`_
   * Open Bonsai and `install the Bonsai.StarterPack package <https://bonsai-rx.org/docs/articles/packages.html>`_

#   Connect a computer to the commutator using a micro-USB cable (connector 1 in the figure below) to establish
    power and communication between the commutator and the computer. For this quick start guide, the coaxial connections
    are not needed.

    ..  note:: The commutator's RGB LED will flash red when the commutator is plugged in. During this time, the
        commutator is charging an internal supercapacitor bank that prevents the motor from loading the USB port. This
        can take up to 30 seconds to complete.

#   Position the commutator on a table and ensure there is nothing preventing the commutator's gears from rotating
    freely.

#   Download and run the following .bonsai file (also known as a "workflow") for controlling the commutator using key
    presses:
